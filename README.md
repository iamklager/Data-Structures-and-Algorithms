# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository's entire purpose lies within tracking my process of working through the book *A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms* by *Jay Wengrow*, particularly the included exercises.  
  
All exercises have been solved in **python** and have not been updated after reviewing the sample solution.
